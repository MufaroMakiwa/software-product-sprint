            development class where we were taught the basics of HTML, CSS, and 
            Javascript as well React.js and Node.js.

            is a progress tracker targeting high school and college students 
            which helps them keep track of tasks that they intend to do on a daily, 
            weekly or monthly basis. To encourage users to use our platform more, we 
            added a feature whereby each user can connect with friends and challenge 
            each other to do tasks.

            MutapaMaps is an Android Application that is aimed to improve the navigation 
            system in Zimbabwe. While working with a start-up in Zimbabwe called Mutapa, 
            I helped to develop the Motapa Location Encoding System that 
            helps to navigate to remote areas in Zimbabwe which are normally not 
            reachable using any of the known Location Encoding Systems, as well as 
            communicate one’s location using a short alpha-numeric called Hexcode.

            As a way to apply what I learnt from MIT’s introduction to Algorithms class (6.006), 
            I wrote this code that finds a solution to any crossword puzzle given its 
            possible solutions. This program implements the back-tracking algorithm and 
            it is guaranteed to find a solution to a crossword puzzle from the given 
            list of solutions.

            Given a Hexcode (described above) that identifies a location in Zimbabwe, 
            this algorithm helps to determine the province/district/ward of Zimbabwe that 
            point is in. Zimbabwe is divided into 10 administrative provinces, which are 
            divided into 59 districts and 1,200 wards. I gathered data from Open Street 
            Map in the form of (latitude, longitude) pairs that describes the polygon 
            around each of these subdivisions.
          </span>

          <span class="project_description">
            Using this data, I worked with one of my colleagues to device an 
            algorithm that can determine the province/district/ward a location 
            is in, given its Hexcode. This then helps to produce Hexcodes that 
            are shorter and more meaningful to the end users as well as minimize the number 
            of characters each person would have to memorize for any particular Hexcode.
